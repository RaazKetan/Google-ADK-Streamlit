## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ADK_NEWS_AGENT
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash

source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Get Your Google API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 5: Create Environment File
Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory and add:
```
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="FALSE"
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```
**Important**: Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real API key from Step 4.

### Step 6: Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run news_app.py
```

The app will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
ADK_NEWS_AGENT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ news_app.py          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                # Environment variables (you create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          # Git ignore file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ check.py            # Simple RSS feed testing script (optional)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required)
- `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`: Set to "FALSE" to use standard Gemini API

### Application Settings (in news_app.py)
- `MAX_ITEMS_TO_PROCESS`: Maximum news items to process (default: 200)
- `MODEL_GEMINI`: AI model to use (default: "gemini-2.0-flash")
- News sources: BBC World News and NPR Headlines (can be modified)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "API Key Not Found" Error
**Problem**: The app shows a red error about missing API key.
**Solution**: 
- Make sure your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Check that your API key is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
- Restart the Streamlit app after creating the `.env` file

#### 2. "Session Not Found" Error
**Problem**: Error message about missing session.
**Solution**: 
- This happens when the app restarts but keeps old session data
- Simply refresh your browser page
- The app automatically handles this in most cases

#### 3. No News Items Found
**Problem**: App says no news found for your date request.
**Solution**:
- Try a more recent date (RSS feeds typically have 1-2 weeks of history)
- Check your internet connection
- Try `latest news` instead of a specific date

#### 4. Slow Response Times
**Problem**: App takes a long time to respond.
**Solution**:
- First request is slower as it fetches and caches news
- Subsequent requests use cached data and are faster
- Check your internet connection speed

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal/console for detailed error messages
2. Make sure all requirements are installed correctly
3. Verify your Python version is 3.8 or higher
4. Ensure your Google API key is valid and has proper permissions

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **API Key Security**: Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control
- **Data Storage**: News data is cached in memory only (lost when app restarts)
- **No Personal Data**: The app doesn't store personal information
- **RSS Feeds**: Only fetches publicly available news feeds

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Customizing News Sources
To add or change news sources, modify the `DEFAULT_FEED_URLS` list in `news_app.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_FEED_URLS = [
    "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml",  # BBC
    "https://feeds.npr.org/1001/rss.xml",     # NPR
    "your_additional_rss_feed_url_here"       # Add more
]
```

### Understanding the Code Structure
- **Tool Function**: `fetch_and_return_news()` handles RSS fetching and filtering
- **Agent Definition**: `root_agent` defines the AI's behavior and instructions
- **Session Management**: ADK handles conversation state and memory
- **UI Components**: Streamlit provides the web interface
